# Mushroom recognization
## Introduction
we build a model to classifier the mushroom species, we use ROC curve to validate the model's performance, and visualization model through Grad-CAM technique.
## Dependency
Run `pip install -r requirement.txt` to install dependency.
## Dataset
We have two dataset, the local dataset that build by ourselves, the open dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com), you can download in <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mustai/mushroom-12-9528>.
## Train
Run `python train.py` to train the model.
## Test
Run `python test.py` to validate the model.
